# Linear Regression with Python

This Python script performs linear regression on a given dataset and plots the regression line. It uses the least squares method to estimate the coefficients of the linear model, which fits the best line through the provided data points.

## Files

- `linear_regression.py`: The main Python script containing functions for estimating coefficients, plotting the regression line, and executing the main logic.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting.

You can install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
